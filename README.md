# Owen Alien ~~Zoo~~   Fudge
This project was originally going to be for zoo but I ran out of time so now I'm submitting it for fudge fudge fudge.

This project tought me a ton about web developement and jasvascript.
I had done a very little amount of HTML before but this was my first project.
It went decent despite some problems with spacing and stuff.

I have done a bit of java script before but nothing as complex as this.

I had to do lots of googling and reading docs to make this work.

Svelte was probably not the easiest way for me to learn all this but I'm done with it now.

The site is pretty simple with a couple "facts" and an interact page.
Theres just a couple of pages but this took me a while.
I spent a while debugging do if I did it again it would have been much quicker.
